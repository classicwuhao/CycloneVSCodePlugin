An implementation of the FIX (Financial Information Exchange) protocol.

Currently the implementation is pre-alpha.  It is not even close to working.

A very simple test can be performed by running the test server and test clients as
follows :

>node testFIXServer.js
>node testFIXClient.js

Both programs should start communicating with each other.  Wait a few seconds to see
heart-beat messages fly by.

Note: The whole point of putting this out in public is to get feedback and code
contributions.
